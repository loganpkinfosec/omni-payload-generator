Omni-Payload-Generator is a versatile toolkit designed for penetration testers and security professionals to efficiently generate diverse types of reverse shell commands and perform environmental checks. This Python-based tool offers a robust feature set that includes generating commands for Bash, Netcat, Perl, Python, and PowerShell, among others. It uniquely supports encoding options like URL encoding and Base64, and caters to specialized scenarios with IFS variable manipulation for command injection or server-side template injection (SSTI).

# Key Features
- **Multiple Reverse Payload Generation**: Generate reverse shell payloads with ease using various technologies including Bash, Python, PowerShell, and much more.
- **Environment Testing**: Includes functionality to generate payloads for identifying shell environments, such as PowerShell/CMD (Windows) and Bash/Sh (Unix/Linux).
- **Advanced Encoding Options**: Supports URL, Internal Field Separator (IFS), and Base64 encoding to obfuscate and bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAF), enhancing penetration testing efforts.
